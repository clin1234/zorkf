# MFZork: a modern clone of Zork in Fortran (with snarkiness by default)

## Installation

Currently, while the Fortran source files are Fortran 2018-compliant, I have
only tested compilation with `gfortran`.

One liner: `gfortran -Wall -Wextra -pedantic <source files>`

## TODO

- [] Implement resource file system (customizable commands, responses, items, etc.)
- [] Use CI to produce build artifacts on other modern Fortran compilers
- [] Add more snarkiness?

## Copyright

All human-readable source files (files readable using a text editor as-is) are
under the public domain.
